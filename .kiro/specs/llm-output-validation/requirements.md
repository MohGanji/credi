# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the reliability of LLM (Large Language Model) interactions by adding an optional validation parameter to the AgentExecutorService. Currently, when LLM responses fail to parse into expected formats, the system falls back to displaying raw output, which provides poor user experience and unreliable data processing. This feature will allow developers to specify an expected Zod schema as an optional parameter, and the service will handle validation, simple retries, and type safety automatically.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using LLM services, I want to specify an expected Zod schema as an optional parameter so that I can reliably get structured, validated responses without handling parsing logic myself.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calling AgentExecutorService methods THEN developers SHALL be able to pass an optional Zod schema parameter
2. WHEN a schema is provided THEN the system SHALL validate LLM responses against it before returning
3. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL automatically retry up to 2 times with enhanced prompts
4. WHEN validation succeeds THEN the system SHALL return the parsed, type-safe data matching the requested type

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to define response schemas using Zod so that I can ensure type safety throughout the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining LLM response expectations THEN developers SHALL be able to use Zod schemas for validation
2. WHEN defining LLM response expectations THEN developers SHALL automatically get TypeScript types from Zod schemas
3. WHEN validation occurs THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages about schema violations
4. WHEN validation fails completely THEN the system SHALL throw a ValidationError with the original response

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to automatically improve prompts on validation failures so that retry attempts have higher success rates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initial validation fails THEN the system SHALL enhance the prompt with JSON schema information
2. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL include a simple instruction to return valid JSON
3. WHEN all retries fail THEN the system SHALL throw an error with validation details

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want seamless integration with existing AgentExecutorService so that I can add validation by simply passing an optional parameter without changing any other code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validation is not needed THEN existing AgentExecutorService calls SHALL work exactly as before
2. WHEN validation is needed THEN developers SHALL only need to add an optional schema parameter to existing method calls
3. WHEN using different LLM providers THEN validation SHALL work uniformly across all supported models
4. WHEN validation fails completely THEN the system SHALL throw a clear ValidationError rather than returning raw unparseable output
