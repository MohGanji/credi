# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the reliability of LLM (Large Language Model) interactions by adding an optional validation parameter to the AgentExecutorService. Currently, when LLM responses fail to parse into expected formats, the system falls back to displaying raw output, which provides poor user experience and unreliable data processing. This feature will allow developers to specify an expected output schema as an optional parameter, and the service will handle validation, retries, and type safety automatically, ensuring reliable structured responses.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using LLM services, I want to specify an expected output type as an optional parameter so that I can reliably get structured, validated responses without handling parsing logic myself.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calling AgentExecutorService methods THEN developers SHALL be able to pass an optional schema parameter
2. WHEN a schema is provided THEN the system SHALL validate LLM responses against it before returning
3. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL automatically retry with enhanced prompts
4. WHEN validation succeeds THEN the system SHALL return the parsed, type-safe data matching the requested type

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want configurable retry policies so that I can balance between response reliability and API cost/latency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the system THEN administrators SHALL be able to set maximum retry attempts
2. WHEN configuring the system THEN administrators SHALL be able to set retry delay intervals
3. WHEN configuring the system THEN administrators SHALL be able to enable/disable validation per model type
4. WHEN retry limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL log detailed failure information for debugging

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to leverage existing proven libraries for LLM output validation so that I can benefit from established patterns and avoid reinventing the wheel.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing validation THEN the system SHALL research and evaluate existing libraries like LangChain's output parsers, Instructor, or similar solutions
2. WHEN choosing a validation approach THEN the system SHALL prioritize libraries that integrate well with our existing LangChain infrastructure
3. WHEN existing libraries meet our needs THEN the system SHALL use them instead of building custom validation
4. WHEN existing libraries are insufficient THEN the system SHALL extend them or build minimal custom logic on top

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to define response schemas using TypeScript types or Zod schemas so that I can ensure type safety throughout the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining LLM response expectations THEN developers SHALL be able to use Zod schemas for validation
2. WHEN defining LLM response expectations THEN developers SHALL be able to derive TypeScript types from schemas
3. WHEN validation occurs THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error messages about schema violations
4. WHEN schemas are updated THEN existing LLM calls SHALL automatically use the new validation rules

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to automatically improve prompts on validation failures so that retry attempts have higher success rates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initial validation fails THEN the system SHALL enhance the prompt with schema information
2. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL include examples of correct format in retry prompts
3. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL specify the exact validation errors in the retry prompt
4. WHEN using different LLM providers THEN the system SHALL adapt prompt enhancement strategies per provider

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want comprehensive logging and monitoring of validation failures so that I can identify and resolve systematic issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL log the original response, validation errors, and retry attempts
2. WHEN validation succeeds after retries THEN the system SHALL log the number of attempts required
3. WHEN systematic failures occur THEN the system SHALL provide aggregated failure metrics
4. WHEN debugging issues THEN operators SHALL have access to full request/response chains for failed validations

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want seamless integration with existing AgentExecutorService so that I can add validation by simply passing an optional parameter without changing any other code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validation is not needed THEN existing AgentExecutorService calls SHALL work exactly as before
2. WHEN validation is needed THEN developers SHALL only need to add an optional schema parameter to existing method calls
3. WHEN using different LLM providers THEN validation SHALL work transparently across all supported models
4. WHEN validation fails completely THEN the system SHALL throw a clear error rather than returning raw unparseable output
